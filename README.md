# CSCI3415-AdaCalc
Simple calculator written in Ada

This program implements a simple four-operator calculator supporting floating point numbers and parenthesis in the Ada programming language.  It uses a recursive parsing algorithm with two unbounded generic (template) stacks and can handle expressions containing any valid combination of the four operators and any number of nested, balanced parenthesis but does not handle unary operators such as unary negate (-).
